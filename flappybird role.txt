Responsibilities:






lives system (starts with 3 lives, loses 1 on collision).






Set initial difficulty (easy: moderate gaps, shorter buildings).












Handle game states (start, playing, game over: lives = 0, restart).






Implement scoring (10 points per normal coin collected).


Add randomized coin spawning: normal coins (often, e.g., 70% spawn chance) and health coins (rarely, e.g., 5% spawn chance).






Add logic for health coins (rare, +1 life each).






Record top 3 scores (store in a file or array).


Deliverables:










Helicopter physics with flapping and gravity.






Lives system (3 initial lives, health coins for extra lives).






Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on score.






Game state management (start, game over, restart).






Scoring logic (normal coins only) and health coin logic.






Top 3 score tracking.




scoring, coin collection, health coins, and difficulty scaling.


Dependencies:
